# coding-assignment

In this course, you will learn how to crack coding interviews methodically. You will gain solid foundation required in Math, Data structures & Algorithms and the confidence to solve problems and implement solutions within stipulated time.

This course helps pursue development or automation opportunities in product based companies anywhere in the world. You can also apply the learning while working as a freelancer or launching your own thing.

Data structures & Algorithms are the foundation of computer science regardless of which language you code them in and where you go.
